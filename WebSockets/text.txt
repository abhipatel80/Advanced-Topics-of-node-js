=> WebSockets are a communication protocol that provides full-duplex, bidirectional communication channels over a single TCP connection. They are commonly used in real-time applications such as chat applications, online gaming, and collaborative tools. In Node.js, you can implement WebSockets using the ws library. 

=> WebSockets are widely used in chat applications, allowing users to exchange messages and updates in real time. Popular messaging platforms like Slack and WhatsApp use WebSockets for instant messaging.

=> Online multiplayer games require real-time communication for game events, player movements, and updates. 
=> WebSockets provide low-latency communication between players and the game server.

=> Tools like collaborative document editors, whiteboards, and project management software benefit from WebSockets to allow multiple users to work together in real time.

=> WebSockets can be used to deliver live updates, notifications, or real-time data in streaming applications.

=> In microservices architectures, WebSockets can be used for internal service communication or to communicate with external systems, providing real-time updates or command and control.

=> Real-time dashboards and data visualization tools use WebSockets to update charts, graphs, and statistics as data changes in real time.
