=> Microservices architecture is a design pattern where an application is divided into small, loosely coupled, and independently deployable services, each responsible for a specific business capability.

=> Node.js is well-suited for building microservices due to its non-blocking and event-driven nature, which allows you to handle a high number of concurrent requests efficiently.

=> Implement an API Gateway to provide a unified entry point for clients and route requests to the appropriate microservice. Tools like Express.js can be used for building the API Gateway.

=> Each microservice should have its own database or data store. Avoid shared databases between microservices to prevent tight coupling.

=> Implement user authentication and authorization for each microservice. You can use OAuth2, JWT, or other authentication mechanisms to secure your services.

=> Implement centralized error handling and logging to monitor and troubleshoot issues across microservices

=> Write tests for each microservice to ensure they function correctly in isolation and when integrated with other services. Tools like Mocha and Chai are commonly used for testing Node.js applications.
